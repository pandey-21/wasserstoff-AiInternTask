# AI-Powered Document Research & Theme Identification Chatbot

This project is a submission for the Wasserstoff AI Software Intern qualification task. It's a fully functional web application designed to act as an intelligent research assistant, capable of ingesting a large corpus of documents, providing precisely cited answers, and synthesizing high-level thematic insights.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Multi-Format Document Ingestion**: Supports various document types, including text-based PDFs, scanned PDFs, plain text files, and images (`.png`, `.jpg`).
*   **Robust OCR for Scanned PDFs**: For image-based PDFs, the system renders each page as a high-resolution image and uses an OCR engine to accurately extract text.
*   **Advanced Two-Stage RAG**:
    1.  **Per-Document Analysis**: Extracts answers with precise citations (page and paragraph) from each document individually.
    2.  **Thematic Synthesis**: Analyzes the individual answers to identify and summarize overarching themes across the entire document set.
*   **Interactive Web Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI built with Streamlit allows for easy document upload and querying.
*   **Idempotent & Robust**: The system intelligently handles duplicate file uploads and is resilient against common failures in LLM responses and document processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: Streamlit
*   **Backend & Core Logic**: Python
*   **LLM Provider**: Groq (for high-speed Llama 3 inference)
*   **Vector Database**: ChromaDB (with its built-in embedding model)
*   **Document Processing**: PyMuPDF & Tesseract
*   **Data Validation**: Pydantic

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
